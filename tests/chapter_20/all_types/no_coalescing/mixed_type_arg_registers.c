/* Make sure our analysis recognizes which registers are used by each function
 * call - same idea as chapter_20/int_only/no_coalescing/track_arg_registers.c,
 * but with structs too. Liveness analysis should recognize that only XMM0-XMM1
 * and RDI, RSI, and RDX are live right before we call callee().
 * If we assume any other parameter-passing registers are also live,
 * we'll conclude they're live from the start of the function until the
 * function call (since they're never updated) and won't be able to allocate
 * them, resulting in spills.
 * Test script validates that only 15 instructions in target access memory:
 * 8 to populate structures, and 7 to transfer those structures into
 * param-passing registers/push them onto the stack
